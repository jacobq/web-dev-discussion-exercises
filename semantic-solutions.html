<!-- We'd hope someof the following would be caught:

- html attribute of id but style defined as class selector
- bad use of id, should use class.
- div (block elements) can't be inside a span
- <span> should be <div> or other appropriate block tag
- Non-semantic class name, should relate to content/purpose rather than physical property.
- Bad use of !important. Shouldn't ever need it.
- css rule shouldn't require display: block if using appropriate block tag
- inside <div> should be <p>
